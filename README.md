# INFS3603--Introduction-to-Business-Analytics

### Motivation
**Requirement Summary:**
•	Address the challenges of water scarcity and waste management in the Australian agricultural industry by leveraging data analytics.

•	Analyse water consumption across various states and agricultural commodities to identify key areas of improvement.

•	Benchmark waste production within the agriculture sector against other industries to propose sustainable practices.

•	Provide actionable insights for enhancing ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) performance among Australian farmers.

### Summary of the assignment:
• **Data Processing:** Utilized Python for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation. The data includes water usage and waste production metrics across different states and industries.

•	**Modelling and Analysis:** Implemented CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) to structure the analytics process, which included building data visualizations and predictive models to identify patterns in water usage and waste management.

•**Visualization:** Developed dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboards to visually represent insights on water consumption, crop production, and waste management trends over multiple years.

### Summary of Results 
•	**Water Usage Insights:**
 
- Identified NSW, QLD, and VIC as the top states in water consumption, with significant usage attributed to nurseries, fruit trees, and vegetables.
  
- A consistent trend over multiple years shows that these states and commodities have the highest water demands, underscoring the need for efficient water management strategies.
   
• **Waste Management Findings:**
  
- Highlighted the dominance of masonry materials in waste production within the agricultural sector, followed by organics and hazardous waste.
    
- Emphasized the necessity for specific waste management strategies to mitigate the environmental impact of these waste categories.
  
**Recommendations:** 
  
- Proposed the implementation of robust water infrastructure to optimize the use of available resources and reduce the reliance on high water-consuming crops.
  
- Suggested the adoption of sustainable waste management practices, including increased recycling efforts and the development of greener materials for agricultural use.
